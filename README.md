Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

Simple coding exercise to implement a tic-tac-toe game in [Haskell][1].

I am no Haskell super-star. And I don't have a lot of experience in Test-Driven
Development. I am confident that there are better ways to do what I've done here.

I'm a die-hard [vim][2] fanatic. However, I *love* [logical symbols][3] and
[mathematical symbols][4] and *love* to use those in my Haskell programming. Try
as I may, I could not get vim to render these. So I <shudders> used [emacs][5]
with its [viper mode][6], as well as [haskell mode][7], and [DejaVu Sans Mono][8].
It made programming that much more fun!
